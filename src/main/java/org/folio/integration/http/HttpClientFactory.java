/*
This factory allows for a single WebClient for each instance of Vert.x
Typically there should only be one of these in the production use of the code
as there is only one instance of vert.x

Unfortunately, the existing tests rely on creating and disposing of vert.x
during each test which leads to the underlying vert.x instance being
taken away underneath the production code.

Meaning that if a single WebClient (dependent upon the underlying vert.x instance)
is used, it breaks on all but the first test.

Until those tests are changed this code is needed,
even if it is potentially unnecessary in many use cases.
